## Using Typora to create markdown files

Stewart Lynch recommended this app. He mentions it in several of his videos including:

[Publish to the web with GitHub Pages and Typora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Cod5xUV1w)

I used the free trial for 15 days then purchased the app for $15 plus tax.

The utility can be downloaded from: [Typora](https://typora.io)
